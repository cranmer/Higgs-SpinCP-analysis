I follow the following proceedure so far:

1) Open the "truth-level" madgraph samples (before any simulation) in ROOT.For example;>Spin0m_MH125_011_ZZ_4l_8TeV_ahg3ahz3_v222_10.root
       >Spin0p_MH125_011_ZZ_4l_8TeV_ahg1ahz1_v222_100.root

2)Remember that the .lhe versions are converted to .root through the ExRootLHEFConverter in the ExRootAnalysis directory by doing /./ExRootLHEFConverter file_name.lhe file_name.root/ in terminal.

3) Run the selector "Angles.C" by /LHEF->Process("Angles.C");/ in ROOT

4)Produce a root file containing two trees, one for "Spin0m" and one for "Spin0p", with each tree with branches (variables) such as cth1, cth2, cthstr, phi,phi_1 etc and name this file as "____angles.root"

<<<<<<< HEAD
5)Run TMVAClassification.C with "____angles.root" as input file and produce plots to differentiate between Spin0p (Signal) vs Spin0m (Background) using TMVA macros.
